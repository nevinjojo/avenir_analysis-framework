# :star: AVENIR DATA ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK :star:

This is a framework developed in Perl to analyse the data created by the Avenir systems.
The analysis done by the framework will help with finding trends within the products developed, which could help to make the products more user-friendly and efficient.


## Tutorials :fire:
I have created/ collected a bunch of tutorials for people who are interested in learning the basics of Perl and SQL:
- [Perl Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNFFfjsETlyoEkuLKitfPgXdV1aEqofiEnF1ijPwOAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- [SQL Commands & Syntaxes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNFFfjsETlyoEkuLKitfPgXdV1aEqofiEnF1ijPwOAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Basic Data analysis Learnings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNFFfjsETlyoEkuLKitfPgXdV1aEqofiEnF1ijPwOAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Setting up your own VM with Debian](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aG2zR7-DXHVrzmdwIfC5Wf8aUYDE4gfHEJEX2p3mnqE/edit?usp=sharing)


## How to run the framework
- To run all all scripts and store them in the 'reports' directory: `perl main` or `./run`
- To run files from a specific directory: `perl main -s scripts/aix`
- To run files from a specific file: `perl main -s scripts/aix/action_count.sql`
- To store reports in a specific directory: `perl main -d reports/aix`
- To format the script file type: `perl main -f csv`
- To set the name of the client server: `perl main -c aix`

## Command Line flags details
- Source : `-src` or `-s`
- Destination: `-dest` or `-d`
- Format: `-format` or `-f`
- Client: `-client` or `-c`
- Graph: `-g`

## Gnuplot - Graphing reports
To graph the reports generated by the framework you can do one of the following:
- Execute the 'run' bash script with the flag `-g` following the path to file
   *  `./run -g reports/topFeatures.sql`

## TODO
- [x] Learn basic and Perl and SQL :+1: (checkout the tutorials I made!)
- [x] Set up VM :ok_hand:
- [x] Develop a Perl framework that runs SQL on Avenir database
- [x] Recursively execute sql files from any directory
- [x] Move modules to seperate 'pm' files
- [x] Generate command line flags for users
- [x] Add Error log message with a timestamp
- [x] Create run and install bash scripts
- [x] Exception handling for subroutines
- [x] Generate graphs based on report files generated by SQL queries using Gnuplot
- [ ] Make the graphs available for users online (maybe via webserver?) - more research needed
- [ ] Find trends within the products by checking the data returned by the SQL queries :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- [ ] Add any details about framework in Wiki
- [ ] More to come :soon:
