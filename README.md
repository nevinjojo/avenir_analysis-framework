# :star: AVENIR DATA ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK :star:

This is a framework developed in Perl to analyse the data created by the Avenir systems.
The analysis done by the framework will help with finding trends within the products developed, which could help to make the products more user-friendly and efficient.


## Tutorials :fire:
I have created/ collected a bunch of tutorials for people who are interested in learning the basics of Perl and SQL:
- [Perl Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNFFfjsETlyoEkuLKitfPgXdV1aEqofiEnF1ijPwOAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- [SQL Commands & Syntaxes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNFFfjsETlyoEkuLKitfPgXdV1aEqofiEnF1ijPwOAE/edit?usp=sharing)
